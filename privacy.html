        <p>Privacy Policy
            7Suggest website is owned by 7Suggest, which is a data controller of your personal data.

            We have adopted this Privacy Policy, which determines how we are processing the information collected by
            7Suggest, which also provides the reasons why we must collect certain personal data about you. Therefore,
            you must read this Privacy Policy before using 7Suggest website.

            We take care of your personal data and undertake to guarantee its confidentiality and security.

            Personal information we collect:
            When you visit the 7Suggest, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including
            information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the installed cookies on your device.
            Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products you
            view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and how you interact with the Site. We refer
            to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” Moreover, we might collect the personal
            data you provide to us (including but not limited to Name, Surname, Address, payment information, etc.)
            during registration to be able to fulfill the agreement.

            Why do we process your data?
            Our top priority is customer data security, and, as such, we may process only minimal user data, only as
            much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the website. Information collected automatically is used only
            to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding website usage. This
            statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that it would identify any particular user
            of the system.

            You can visit the website without telling us who you are or revealing any information, by which someone
            could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some of the
            website’s features, or you wish to receive our newsletter or provide other details by filling a form, you
            may provide personal data to us, such as your email, first name, last name, city of residence, organization,
            telephone number. You can choose not to provide us with your personal data, but then you may not be able to
            take advantage of some of the website’s features. For example, you won’t be able to receive our Newsletter
            or contact us directly from the website. Users who are uncertain about what information is mandatory are
            welcome to contact us via cabin.wahab@gmail.com.
